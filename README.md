# proj_repo_1

For educational purposes, create a repository on Github holding a catalog of items in markdown format. Which is to say, there should be at least three files in it, all of them writen in plain text (markdown welcome), each describing an item from a collection.

You can use anything as a collection: shampoo brands, must-watch films, gamepad models, etc. Make sure to keep the file format consistent across the items.

BONUS: get a bonus point for publishing the repository on Gitlab as well as on Github.
